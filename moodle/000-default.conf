	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
	RewriteEngine On
	# This will enable the Rewrite capabilities

	RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
	# This checks to make sure the connection is not already HTTPS

	RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
	# This rule will redirect users from their original location, to the same location but using HTTPS.
	# i.e.  http://www.example.com/foo/ to https://www.example.com/foo/
	# The leading slash is made optional so that this will work either in httpd.conf
	# or .htaccess context
